# Conway's Game of Life

This program implements Conway's zero player game, the game of life. A description of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

The program runs on the console and takes one argument as input. An example input text file is include which lists starting (x,y) coordinates of a cell. The game will automatically progress on its own until the cells are no longer able to change.

To run:

```
./GameOfLife input.txt
```
